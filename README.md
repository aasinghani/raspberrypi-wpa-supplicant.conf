# Raspberry Pi Wifi Configuration File
Help you to setup a wpa supplicant configuration file for Raspbian Stretch or later on new headless Rasbian installation.

## Getting Started
These will be step-by-step instruction on how to create the configuration file on any OS and Rasbian installation.

## Prerequisites
**Git** or **Git for Windows** needs to be install on the pc. You can download a copy from [Git Official Website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

## How to use
1. Run the following command in command prompt or terminal window:
```
git clone https://github.com/asparatu/raspberrypi-wpa-supplicant.conf.git
```
2. Move into the folder
```
cd raspberrypi-wpa-supplicant.conf
```
3. Edit the configuration file
```
Linux: nano wpa_supplicant.conf
